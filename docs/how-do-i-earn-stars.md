Stars are awarded for high-quality, original comments. If your comments aren't earning stars, focus on being more original and adding unique insights. Originality increases your chances of being noticed and earning recognition. However, don’t stress too much about stars—write about what genuinely interests you. Enjoy the process rather than trying to optimize every detail.
