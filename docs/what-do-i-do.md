During the Festival, your main goal is to write high-quality comments to earn as many stars as possible. At the end of the Festival, youâ€™ll participate in the *Standpoint*, where you share your final opinion on a chosen topic. Schools that actively participate and rank on the leaderboard can win prizes. You can find the full list of prizes [here](https://talk.economistfoundation.org/festivals/festival-2025/awards/).
